# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

The aim of this project is to investigate and visualise data using various data science tools. In this project, we:
1. read data files in Python and extract related data from those files;
2. wrangle and process data;
3. use various graphical and non-graphical tools to perform exploratory data analysis and visualisation;
4. use basic tools for managing and processing big data; and
5. communicate findings.

#### Environment: Python 3 and Anaconda Jupyter Notebook 5.5.0 (64-bit)
